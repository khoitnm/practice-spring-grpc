# Introduction
This example shows how to download file with data *STREAM*.
This is only used when you don't download a small file.
If you download a big file, you should use data stream.

# Run
1. Start the server `stream-download-file-server`
2. Start the client `stream-download-file-client`, 
then you'll see in the log the content of the file which was downloaded from the server application.
