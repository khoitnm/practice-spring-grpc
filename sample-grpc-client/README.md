You can use grpcc for testing connection to gRPC servers: https://github.com/njpatel/grpcc

However, this application will give an an example how to connect to gRPC servers with Java code.

The central code is just one class `ItenSampleGrpcClient`.

All of other classes are used to just provide a REST layer so that you can test it from your POSTMAN or Browser.
